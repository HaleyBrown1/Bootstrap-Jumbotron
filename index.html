The goal is to win either 2 out of 3 matches or 3 out of 5 matches and each match goes to 25 points. I play volleyball during most of my freetime, I play for the school and I also play for a club tea, out of Memphis.</div>
                <div class="col-md-6"><b><i>Watching football</i></b> - a sport where a form of team game played with an oval ball on a field marked out as a gridiron. Points are scored mainly through touchdowns and field goals. Each side has eleven players on the field at any time. I grew up watching football my whole life, my brother played football his whole life so I went to all of his games and so football is a big part of me and my families life. </div>
